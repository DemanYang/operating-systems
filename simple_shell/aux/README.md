Shell Program - Programming Assignment
=============

Implement a simple command line shell program in C that interacts with the user in the following way. By default, the shell gives a prompt to the user. When the user types in a command (in response to its prompt) and hits Enter, the shell creates a child process that executes the command he entered and displays the results if any. It then prompts for more user input by displaying the prompt again. 

The shell can be limited to handling basic commands that do not involve piping and redirection.
